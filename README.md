# Coffee Shop Rewards Program

Welcome to the Coffee Shop Rewards Program! This project demonstrates a Java-based rewards program for a coffee shop. The program tracks customer orders and rewards loyal customers with discounts and bonus bucks.

## Project Description

The Coffee Shop Rewards Program is a backend application that handles customer loyalty for a coffee shop. The program stores customer information and tracks their orders. It offers a user-friendly menu system for order tracking and provides an option to redeem rewards based on the number of points earned.

Please note: This project is purely for demonstration purposes and does not process actual payments or rewards.

## Key Features

- **Customer Tracking**: Stores customer information and tracks their orders.
- **Order Tracking**: Allows users to track their orders and view their rewards points.
- **Reward Redemption**: Provides an option to redeem rewards based on the number of points earned.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Java Programming**: Utilizes Java programming fundamentals such as object-oriented programming, file I/O, loops, conditional statements, and arrays.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Implements customer classes with inheritance and polymorphism.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures that user data falls within the proper range and prevents users from redeeming rewards without sufficient points.
- **User Interface Design**: Presents a user-friendly menu system for order tracking and reward redemption.
- **File Handling**: Reads from and writes to files in Java, demonstrating understanding of file I/O operations.
- **Exception Handling**: Handles potential exceptions or errors in the code to ensure robustness of the application.
- **Problem Solving**: Designs and implements a solution to the problem at hand, demonstrating critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

## Technical Details

The Coffee Shop Rewards Program is developed using Java. It employs file I/O to read and write customer information from and to a file. The program validates user inputs and handles reward redemption based on the number of points earned.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to enhance the app with the following features:

- **Customer Authentication**: Allow customers to create accounts for personalized experiences.
- **Multiple Rewards**: Extend the system to handle multiple rewards with different point values.
- **Advanced Order Tracking**: Provide an option for users to view their order history and order details.
